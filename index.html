            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my self Simran Kaur. I <em>am</em> student of Algonquin college. 
                I'm quite interested in <abbr title="web development">WEBD</abbr>, and I intend to work 
                in that industry once I graduate. I think it's an area that has 
                a lot of potential for both professional and personal development. 
                I <em>am</em> looking forward to meeting new people, being more social, 
                and learning from my teachers. I want to get the most out of my 
                time in college and develop into a successful person. 
                </p>
            <p>I like to do sports and listen to music when I have free time. 
                I also read a lot, and my favourite subjects to read about are 
                finance and economics. I'm an extremely social individual that enjoys meeting new people. 
                I <em>am</em> eager to get to know every one of you better and meet you <sup>all.</sup></p>
